# Package data for Datapackage Registry

Datapackage Registry "understands" the contents of a source data file via another "descriptor" called a [Data Package](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/).

In fact, the Datapackage Registry Datastore does not strictly store any old data file, but rather, it stores Data Packages, being a collection of data sources and a `datapackage.json` descriptor file.

## Creating a Data Package

## Validating a Data Package

- [DPM CLI](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/dpm-py)
- [DataPackage Lib](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-py)

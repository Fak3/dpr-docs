# Upload data into Datapackage Registry

It is possible to upload Data Packages into Datapackage Registry via a CLI.


## Using the CLI

- [Code repo](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/dpm-py)
- [CLI docs](/en/latest/developers/cli/)

The CLI provides a simple command line interface to interact with a Datapackage Registry instance. Using the CLI, you can authenticate with a Datapackage Registry instance and then push data directly to the datastore.

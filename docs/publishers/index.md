# Getting started

Let's get started then!

## Getting data in

### Prepare

Datapackage Registry loads and stores data in various formats according to the [Data Package specification](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/), incluing common data formats such as CSV and JSON. Read this section of the documentation to learn how to ensure your data is ready to add to Datapackage Registry.

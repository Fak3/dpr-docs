# Authorization Set up

  Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something. In multi-user systems, a system administrator defines for the system which users are allowed access to the system and what privileges of use.

We have a standard access control matrix with 3 axes:

- Actions: CREATE, READ, WRITE, DELETE, PURGE
- Entities (object): User, Publisher, Package, Package Resource, …
- Users: a user or type of user

## Introducing Roles

It can be inefficient to list every user for every object. It is also cumbersome to manage in terms of business processes. For example:

Many users in an organization get same set of privileges because of their position in the organization.
We want to change the permissions associated with a certain level in the organization and to have those permissions changed for all people in that level
A user may change level frequently (ex. user may get promoted)
So we create roles

* Per object roles e.g. Package Owner
* Per system roles e.g. System Administrator
* A list or algorithm for assigning Users => Roles

Access control algorithm:
```pytho
is_allowed(user, entity, action tuple)
```

For this user: what roles do they have related to this entity and the system?
Given those roles: what actions do they have: UNIONrole
Note: it would get more complex if some roles deny access. E.g. Role: Spammer might mean you are denied action to posting etc. Right now we don’t have that issue.
Is the desired action in that set?

### Roles
- Package
    - Owner  => all actions
    - Editor
        - Read
        - Create
        - Delete
        - Undelete
        - Update
        - Tag
    - Viewer  => Only read
- Publisher
    - Owner => all actions on Publisher
    - Editor
        - ViewMemberList
        - AddMember
        - RemoveMember
        - Read
    - Viewer => Only Read
- System
    - LoggedIn
        - Package::Create
        - Publisher::Create
    - All => Package::Read on public packages
    - Sysadmin => all actions

### Business roles

- Publisher Owner
    - Publisher::Owner
- Publisher Member
    - Publisher::Editor
- (Logged in) User
    - System::LoggedIn
- Sys Admin
    - System::Sysadmin
- Visitor
    - System::Anonymous


> NOTE: business roles and authorization roles are distinct. Of course, in implementing access control we will use the business logic inherent in business roles. However, business roles are not explicitly present in the access control system.

## Actions

> Note: not an exhaustive list

- Package:
    - Package::Read
    - Package::Create
    - Package::Delete
    - Package::Undelete
    - Package::Purge
    - Package::Update
    - Package::Tag
- Publisher:
    - Publisher::Create
    - Publisher::AddMember
    - Publisher::RemoveMember
    - Publisher::Read
    - Publisher::Delete
    - Publisher::Update
    - Publisher::ViewMemberList

## Examples
### First time visitor or not logged in:
The business role will be ```System::Anonymous```. So the user can only has the action permission of ```Package::Read```.
So the user can only view the public data packages.

### Logged in user:
The business role will be ```System::LoggedIn``` . So the user will have permission of :

- ```Publisher::Create``` : The user can create new publisher.
- ```Package::Create``` : The user can create new data package.
- ```Package::Read``` : Can read public data packages
